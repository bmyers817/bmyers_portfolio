<h2><font size="15">Scratch</font></h2>
<p><font size=5>One of the languages that I have learned is Scratch. Scratch is a free-to-use website with preset blocks of code that can be mixed around to perform a task. If you want to code in Scratch, click on the logo below to visit the site!</font></p>

<h3><font size="9">Scratch Project</font></h3>

<img src="images/Scratch Project link.png" height="200">
</a>
<p><font size=5>Using scratch, I created a game. My partner, Alex Hughes, and I created this game in a couple of days! Using our minds, we made a historical satire on Cold-War Era communism. In the game, you play as Joseph Stalin, and you travel to three distinct locations in the Eastern World to spread communism and defeat capitalism. In this program, we implemented numerous amounts of algorthims. In fact, the movement for the main character, "Stalin", utilizes several algorithms. Additionally, the character's attack actions utilize an algrithm to determine the direction of the attack. In addition to algorithms, this project made use of a multitude of variables so as to set the health for both the character and all of the bosses. Additionally, some of the enviornments are interactive, such as the China level, where the boss attempts to throw a block labeled "capitalism" at you. This block can be hit out of the boss's hands and reset back to its original position. Whilst this project only took a few days, I am thoroughly satisfied with the end product. I believe it meets all of the acceptable standards for the project and provides an interesting game for all to enjoy.</font></p>

<p><font size=5>Another language that I have learned is MIT APP Inventor. APP Inventor is a free-to-use program that utilizes blocks of code that can mixed around similar to scratch to design programs and apps for android systems.

<img src="images/Wild West Duelers.png" height="500">
</a>
<p>Using APP Inventor, I created a game. My partner, Shaun Boscovich, and I created a game with APP Inventor in a small time frame. We made an 8-bit arcade style western game for two players. In the game, player one and player two move up and down the screen at different rates. One player shoots faster while the other moves up and down faster. Each player can be shot 4 times before death. Once one player is "dead", the game ends and the other player wins. In this program, we implemented a variety of algrothims for the movement of the characters as well as for their shooting. Additionally, we have a music screen implemented so that the user can customize the ambiance for the game. In addition to the movement algrorithms, this program utilizes variables for the health of the players. While the game is rather simple in execution, I believe that it serves its purpose to entertain extensively.</p>

<h4><font size="15">Python (Repl.it & Canopy)</font></h4>
<a target="_blank" href="https://repl.it/">

</a>
<p>Another Language I learned was Python. Python is a text-based command language that is utilized across multiple programs. The programs that I coded in are Repl.it and Canopy. Repl.it is a free-to-use program that allows you to code in multiple languages of code. If you wish to code in repl.it, click the logo!</p>

<br>




<p>Using Repl.it, I created a text-based adventure. Using repl.it, my partner, Deonarain Mamo, and I created a text-based adventure about Vladimir Lenin. This adventure, titled "Lenin's Rise to Power", follows Vladimir Lenin's formation of the communist party in Russia. In the adventure, the user is faced with some of the key choices that Lenin faced during his lifetime. Depending on the decisions that the user makes, a different outcome can occur. Each outcome branches down to different endings, creating a flow for the adventure. Multiple algorithms were added to the program to assist with the decisions of the user.</p>

<h5><font size="15">Tic Tac Toe</font></h5>

<br>




<p>Similar to the previous project, I coded in python using repl.it. This time around, my partner, Vincent Azpeitia, and I created a tic tac toe game. Our original plan was to create an AI to face off against the player. However, due to some complications in the project, we were unable to accomplish this. Instead, a two player game was developed, in which players take turns to play. While the end product was not the intended outcome, we were satisfied with how it was finalized.</p>

<p>Using Canopy, my partner, Connor Burns, and I created a image filter. As seen above, when the the code is run, the program will change some pixels in an image to blue and shift a portion of the image. This project was done over the course of a few days, and both my partner and I contributed to its success. We coded in alternation, switching approximately every 10 minutes. We kept the code short and conscise, so as to reduce the complexity of the program.</p>

<h7><font size="15">Presentations</font></h7>

<br>

<p>Throughout the year in computer science, the class was tasked with presenting different topics. These topics focused on topics related to the computational field. Subjects such as Malware and Big Data. To create the presentations I utilized Microsoft Powerpoint. If you want to download Powerpoint, click the image below to visit the website.</p>

<h8><font size="15">Malware Presentation</font></h8>
<br>
<img src="images/Malware Presentation.PNG" height="500">

<br>

<p>One of the topics that I presented this year was Malware. For this assignment, the class was tasked with presenting information on a malware of our choice. The malware I selected was the ZeroAccess virus. The ZeroAccess virus is a virus that pretends to be a user friendly message to attempt to trick the user into downloading it. Following this, the virus serves as a backdoor for hackers, usually for bitcoin mining.</p>
<br>

<h9><font size="15">Big Data Presentation</font></h9>
<br>
<img src="images/Computational Innovation-Big Data.png" height="500">
<p>One of the other topics that I presented this year was Big Data. For this assignment, the class was tasked with presenting information on a Big Data of our choice. I selected Bitcoin Mining. Bitcoin mining is Big Data due to the volume of data that it collects. It uses thousands of computers to generate bitcoins for financial gain.</p>

<br>

<h10><font size="15">Other Assignments</font></h10>
<p>These are the other assignments that I have completed this year.</p>

<h11><font size="15">Data Analysis</font></h11>
<br>
<img src="images/Data Analysis.PNG" height="500">
<br>
<p>One of the assignments the class was tasked with was analyzing data. For this assignment, my partner Deonarain Mamo and I chose to analyze data on population and GDP to see if there was a direct corelation between the two. Using the data, we created a graph to see the connection between the two. We discovered that states with a larger population usually had a better GDP.</p>


<h12><font size="15">Simulation Modification</font></h12>
<br>
<img src="images/Simulation Modification.PNG" height="500">
<br>
<p> One of the other assignments I was tasked with was the modification of a simulation. In this assignment, my partner and I modified a virus simulation to infect multiple individuals through different methods than the original code intended. I changed the code to eliminate a surival chance with the virus, and instead, individuals that were infected either passed on the virus or were infected.</p>
