<p>One of the languages that I have learned is Scratch. Scratch is a free-to-use website with preset blocks of code that can be mixed around to perform a task. If you want to code in Scratch, click on the logo below to visit the site! </p>

<p><font size=5>Using scratch, I created a game. My partner, Alex Hughes, and I created this game in a couple of days! Using our minds, we made a historical satire on Cold-War Era communism. In the game, you play as Joseph Stalin, and you travel to three distinct locations in the Eastern World to spread communism and defeat capitalism. In this program, we implemented numerous amounts of algorthims. In fact, the movement for the main character, "Stalin", utilizes several algorithms. Additionally, the character's attack actions utilize an algrithm to determine the direction of the attack. In addition to algorithms, this project made use of a multitude of variables so as to set the health for both the character and all of the bosses. Additionally, some of the enviornments are interactive, such as the China level, where the boss attempts to throw a block labeled "capitalism" at you. This block can be hit out of the boss's hands and reset back to its original position. Whilst this project only took a few days, I am thoroughly satisfied with the end product. I believe it meets all of the acceptable standards for the project and provides an interesting game for all to enjoy.</font></p>
