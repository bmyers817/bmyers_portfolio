<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="images/Me.JPG" height="250">
<p> Hello, my name is Bradley. I am currently 17 years old and I was born on August 17,2000.</p>
<p> I am a senior at Don Lugo High School. Additionally I play baseball and take a variety of AP classes, including this one.</p>
<p>In the future, I plan to go to a 4-year university and become an engineer.</p>
<br>
<p> Ironically, although I cannot drive a car yet, I race a dragster for the NCSDA.</p>
<p> Since I started to walk, I loved to race. In fact, much of my family and even my grandfather have raced.</p>
