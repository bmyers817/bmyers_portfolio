<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Where I Am Right Now</h2>
<p> Hello, my name is Bradley. I am currently 17 years old and I was born on August 17,2000.</p>
<p> I am a senior at Don Lugo High School. Additionally I play baseball and take a variety of AP classes, including this one.</p>
<h3>Plans For the Future</h3>
<p>In the future, I will be attending UC Merced with a full ride scholarship. I plan to study computer science at Merced, and continue to advance my coding skills. After I graduate from Merced, I plan on working with a starter company to build a resume in my field. After this, I will attempt to transfer to a major company such as Google or RockstarGames.</p>

<h4>Extra Stuff About Me</h4>
<p> Ironically, although I cannot drive a car yet, I race a dragster for the NCSDA.</p>
<p> Since I started to walk, I loved to race. In fact, much of my family and even my grandfather have raced. I actively race my dragster, and I have driven it at speeds above 100 mph. Racing is one of my biggest passions and favorite things to partake in.</p>
